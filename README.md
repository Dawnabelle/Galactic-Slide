## Description
_A solar year lasts 365 days on planet Earth. However, the length of a solar year varies from planet to planet. For instance, a solar year on Mercury lasts 88 days. This an application that determines a user’s age based on a planet’s solar years._ :rocket:

### Specs

Take a person’s age in years and convert it into seconds.

Take two dates and determine the difference, in seconds, between the two.

Return the age of a human in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)

Return the age of a human in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)

Return the age of a human in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)

Return the age of a human in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)

Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet. :skull:

The application will calculate the user’s life expectancy. User inputs the average life expectancy for their demographic.

If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy.
